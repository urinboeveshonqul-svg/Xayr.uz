## 2. Current Completion

Estimates are based on implemented code, not roadmap intent. A "code-complete but
operationally blocked" system (e.g. payments, push) is scored on what exists in the repo.

| Area | Completion | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Overall Platform** | **~74%** | Feature-rich and polished; blocked from real-money operation by the payment gateway gap. |
| Frontend | 95% | Full page set, components, responsive, theming, i18n. |
| Backend (API routes) | 90% | 20 routes, all validated + RBAC; payment provider impl missing. |
| Database | 95% | Schema + 46 migrations; live application unverified. |
| Security | 88% | Strong model; live RLS unverified + minor hardening items. |
| Mobile | 95% | Bottom nav, touch targets, responsive throughout, PWA manifest. |
| SEO | 95% | Metadata, OG images, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots, canonical/hreflang. |
| **Payment System** | **25%** | Abstraction/webhook/idempotency built; **no real gateway** — donations never complete automatically. |
| Notifications (in-app) | 95% | Trigger-driven, complete. |
| Push notifications | 80% (code) | Code-complete; requires OneSignal + Supabase webhook config to go live. |
| Admin Dashboard | 90% | Full surface (stats, campaigns, donations, flags, users, verifications, payouts, messages). |
| Localization | 95% | 3 languages, parity maintained (1352 lines each). |
| Analytics | 60% | Per-campaign creator analytics only; no platform product analytics. |
| Testing / CI | 35% | Build + typecheck CI; **no automated tests**, no lockfile. |

## 3. Completed Features

### Authentication
- **What:** Email/password + username login, Google OAuth, server-side signup, email confirmation, password reset/forgot.
- **Where:** `app/api/auth/{login,signup,username-available}/route.ts`, `app/auth/callback/route.ts`, `components/auth/*`, `app/[locale]/auth/*`, `middleware.ts` (session refresh, fail-open).
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. Login accepts email OR username (resolved via service role); rate-limited; anti-enumeration messaging. Google sign-in maps name/picture into the profile via `handle_new_user`.

### User Profiles
- **What:** Editable profile (full name, bio, phone, avatar, preferred language), public profile page, donor stats with privacy toggle.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/profile/*`, `app/[locale]/u/[username]/page.tsx`, `components/profile/*` (`ProfileForm`, `AvatarUpload`, `UsernameSettings`, `DonorPrivacyToggle`, `VerificationStatusCard`, `FollowButton`).
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### KYC (Identity Verification)
- **What:** Multi-step wizard; uploads ID front/back + selfie to a private bucket; admin review via short-lived signed URLs; approve/reject with reason; status mirrored onto the user row.
- **Where:** `components/verification/VerificationWizard.tsx`, `app/api/verification/submit/route.ts`, `app/api/admin/verifications/route.ts`, `app/[locale]/admin/verifications/page.tsx`, `lib/kyc.ts`. Tables: `verification_requests`, `identity_documents`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. Document storage paths are validated to live under the user's own folder.

### Campaigns (Creation & Management)
- **What:** Create/edit campaigns (title, description, story, goal, category, images, urgent flag, deadline, location), draft→pending→active lifecycle, resubmit after rejection, owner-only field editing.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/campaigns/{create,[slug],[slug]/edit}/*`, `components/campaigns/{CreateCampaignForm,EditCampaignForm,CampaignDetail,CampaignKycGate}.tsx`. Protected columns (`status`, `current_amount`, `donors_count`, `views`) enforced by `guard_campaign_protected_fields` trigger.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. Creation is gated on `verification_status='verified'` (KYC) at the RLS layer (`campaign-create-kyc-gate.sql`).

### Campaign Expiration & Archive
- **What:** At its deadline a campaign is auto-archived — `funded` (goal reached) or `expired` (not). Archived campaigns drop out of all active discovery (homepage/featured/trending/listings/category/search/recommended — every one pins `status='active'`) but **keep their public URL + SEO** (RLS widened so `completed`/`expired`/`funded` stay anon-readable; detail pages stay indexable). The detail page hides Donate and shows **"Successfully Funded"** / **"Campaign Ended"** + "This campaign has ended."; the donations API also rejects a past deadline. Owner dashboard + admin manager gain `expired`/`funded`/`cancelled` filters (Campaign History). Owner is notified on expiry/funding. Donations, analytics, and history are never deleted.
- **Extension:** owner of an **expired, under-goal** campaign requests a new deadline + **reason** (category: treatment/construction/emergency/other; KYC required, ≤30 days out, ≤2 extensions, one pending at a time) from the dashboard. **A request never reactivates the campaign** — it stays `expired` (hidden from all listings, donations off) and shows "Extension request under review."; the owner may **cancel** a pending request (`cancel_campaign_extension` → `cancelled`) and not submit another while one is pending. Admin reviews under **/admin/extensions** (shows raised/goal/remaining, previous-extension count, requested additional days, reason + request date) → Approve reactivates the campaign (`active` + new deadline, restoring discovery + donations) / Reject keeps it expired (owner sees the reason and may re-request under the limit); **owner AND previous donors** are notified on approve, owner on reject. Request status set: `pending`/`approved`/`rejected`/`cancelled`. All writes via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs; the never-deleted request row is the audit trail (user + time + requested date + duration + reason + reviewer + decision date + rejection reason), visible to the owner (dashboard history) and admins.
- **Transparency:** an **"Extended" badge** shows on the campaign card + detail when `extension_count > 0`; the detail page renders a public **Campaign Timeline** (Created → Extended (date)… → terminal) from `get_campaign_extension_history()` (dates only — the reason is never exposed publicly).
- **Manual close & funded:** owner can **Close** a goal-reached active campaign (`close_campaign()` → `funded`); funded-before-deadline stays active until the deadline or manual close.
- **Analytics:** owner analytics shows original vs current end date, # extensions, days extended, and donations **before vs after** the original deadline. All analytics/donations/payout records are immutable (no deletion).
- **Personal collections:** expired/funded campaigns are **kept** in Saved Campaigns and Recently Viewed (no status filter; RLS allows the public archive states). The shared `CampaignCard` renders an **Expired/Funded badge + end date** and swaps the Donate CTA for a disabled "Expired"/"Funded" pill (`aria-disabled` + `aria-label` "no longer accepting donations" — reason never hidden); the card still links to the page so users can read the story/updates/donor history and share. The detail page shows **"This campaign is no longer accepting donations."** Active discovery still excludes archived campaigns (status-pinned).
- **Reactivation sync:** approval is an in-place `UPDATE` (same id/slug; donations/comments/updates/saved/recently_viewed/followers preserved), so every dynamically-rendered surface (detail, listings, search, Saved, Recently Viewed, dashboards, related) shows the restored `active` state on next load with no user action — the card/detail re-derive `ended` from status+deadline, so the Donate button / countdown / remaining days come back and the Expired badge disappears automatically. The **only cached surface** is the ISR homepage (`revalidate = 60`, featured/trending); admin approve/reject now go through `app/api/admin/extensions/route.ts`, which calls the RPC and `revalidatePath('/[locale]')` on approve so the reactivated campaign rejoins featured/trending immediately. Reactivation happens **only** via `approve_campaign_extension` (admin-gated) — a deadline edit alone never flips status.
- **Where:** `supabase/campaign-expiration.sql` (#41) + `campaign-extensions.sql` (#42, self-contained: table + reason + original_deadline + all RPCs); `app/api/cron/expire-campaigns/route.ts` + `vercel.json` cron; `lib/utils.ts`; `components/campaigns/{CampaignDetail,CampaignCard,CampaignTimeline}.tsx`; `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/{page,analytics/page}.tsx`; `app/api/donations/route.ts`; `components/profile/MyCampaigns.tsx` (history filters + extend modal + close); `components/admin/{AdminCampaignsManager,AdminExtensions}.tsx` + `app/[locale]/admin/extensions/page.tsx`.
- **Status:** ✅ Code-complete (pending migrations #41–#42 applied + `CRON_SECRET` set).

### Donations
- **What:** Donation modal with preset/custom amounts, optional message, and a 3-way **name display** (Display my name / First name only / Anonymous). Works for **guests and registered users** on the same campaign page. **Guests** provide name + email (+ optional phone) and pass **Turnstile**; logged-in donors reuse their profile (linked via `donor_id`) and skip those fields. Server creates a **pending** record; client can never set status. Anonymity is derived server-side from the display choice. Guest contact is PII (admin/owner-only via RLS); the public donor feed shows only the chosen display name (`campaign_donors` view handles guest + registered, first-word, and anonymous). The payment-success page shows an on-screen **receipt** (amount/campaign/transaction ref/date) and offers guests a **"Create a XAYR account"** CTA (never forced). Admin donations view distinguishes **guest vs registered**, shows the real name/email/phone even for anonymous donations, and filters by donor type; owner analytics shows a **donor-type breakdown** (total / registered / guest / anonymous).
- **Where:** `components/donations/DonationForm.tsx`, `app/api/donations/route.ts` (Turnstile + guest validation), `components/payments/PaymentSuccessView.tsx` (receipt + account CTA), `components/admin/AdminDonationsReconciliation.tsx` + `app/[locale]/admin/donations/page.tsx` (donor type/contact/filter), `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/analytics/page.tsx` (breakdown); migration `supabase/guest-donations.sql` (#44). Table: `donations` (+ `donor_name`/`donor_email`/`donor_phone`/`name_display`).
- **Status:** ✅ Guest-donation workflow complete (security: Turnstile + rate-limit + server-side validation; status never client-trusted). ⚠️ Still **no completion path** until a payment gateway is wired (see §11); **email** receipts need a transactional-email provider (not yet integrated) — the receipt is shown on-screen meanwhile.

### Notifications (in-app)
- **What:** Bell + notifications view; auto-generated on new donation, comment, campaign milestone, campaign status change, updates, completion reports, payout status, and verification decisions.
- **Where:** `components/notifications/{NotificationBell,NotificationsView}.tsx`, `app/[locale]/notifications/page.tsx`. DB triggers across multiple migrations. Table: `notifications`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Push Notifications
- **What:** Browser web push via OneSignal; per-category preferences; Supabase DB-webhook mirrors new `notifications` rows to push.
- **Where:** `components/push/{OneSignalProvider,PushSettings}.tsx`, `lib/onesignal.ts`, `lib/push-client.ts`, `app/api/push/notify/route.ts`. Table: `notification_preferences`.
- **Status:** ⚠️ Code-complete; requires OneSignal app + Supabase webhook secret configuration to operate (see `docs/push-notifications-setup.md`).

### Sharing
- **What:** Share modal; share-event tracking per source feeding traffic-source analytics.
- **Where:** `components/campaigns/ShareModal.tsx`, `lib/share.ts`, `get_share_stats` RPC. Table: `campaign_shares`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete (anonymous insert; analytics-only — see known issues).

### Analytics (creator-facing)
- **What:** Per-campaign analytics — views, donors, amount over time, traffic sources.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/analytics/page.tsx`, `components/campaigns/CampaignAnalytics.tsx`, `get_share_stats`.
- **Status:** ⚠️ Per-campaign only; no platform-wide product analytics.

### Saved Campaigns (bookmarks)
- **What:** Save/unsave campaigns; saved list page.
- **Where:** `components/campaigns/SaveButton.tsx`, `lib/saved-campaigns.ts`, `app/[locale]/profile/saved/page.tsx`. Table: `saved_campaigns`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Recently Viewed
- **What:** Per-user recently-viewed history (logged-in) + client-side recent strip on home.
- **Where:** `components/campaigns/{RecentlyViewed,ViewTracker}.tsx`, `lib/recently-viewed.ts`, `record_campaign_view` RPC. Table: `recently_viewed`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Team Campaigns
- **What:** Multiple members per campaign with roles (owner / manager / editor); team-aware RLS; completion-report permissions extend to managers.
- **Where:** `components/campaigns/CampaignTeam.tsx`, `campaign_role` function. Table: `campaign_team_members`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Reports (completion reports + abuse flags)
- **Completion reports (moderated, Phase 1):** Creator/manager submits a fund-usage **completion report** on a **completed** campaign — title, ≥200-char summary, **fund-usage breakdown** (category/description/amount, total ≤ total withdrawn), beneficiary status, milestone **timeline**, images/before-after/videos/documents. Reports are **admin-moderated**: a guard trigger forces submissions to `pending` (owners can't self-approve); admins **approve / request changes / reject** with feedback under **/admin/reports** (`review_completion_report`). Only **approved** reports are public (RLS); existing v1 reports were grandfathered as `approved`. The public report shows a **transparency block** (Funds Raised / Withdrawn / Reported / Completion Date / Verified) + "Remaining funds not yet reported" when reported < withdrawn, the breakdown, timeline, gallery, inline videos, and documents. Owner is notified on each decision; donors are notified **on approval** (was: on submit). `components/campaigns/{CompletionReportForm,CompletionReports}.tsx`, `components/admin/AdminReports.tsx`, `app/[locale]/admin/reports/page.tsx`, `app/api/campaigns/reports/route.ts`; migration `supabase/completion-reports-v2.sql` (#43). Table: `campaign_reports` (+ status/fund_breakdown/timeline/beneficiary/media/review columns). ✅ Phase 1 (pending #43 applied). ⏳ Phase 2: Verified-Completion trust badges + creator trust display + search filters + report analytics.
- **Abuse flags:** Authenticated users flag campaigns (fraud/misleading/spam/other); admin resolves. `components/campaigns/ReportCampaignButton.tsx`, `app/api/campaigns/flag/route.ts`, `components/admin/AdminCampaignFlags.tsx`. Table: `campaign_flags`. ✅ Complete.

### "Featured" / Homepage Curation
- **What:** The homepage shows the **first 3 active campaigns** (by recency) as "Featured" and the **top 8 by raised amount** as "Trending."
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/page.tsx` (`featured = campaigns.slice(0,3)`, `trending` sorted by `current_amount`).
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented as a **presentation layer only** — there is **no `is_featured` column or admin curation**. (Documented accurately to avoid implying a backed feature.)

### Success Stories (verified)
- **What:** A campaign appears as a Success Story **only** if ALL hold: goal reached (`current_amount >= goal_amount`), status `completed`/`funded`, and an **admin-approved completion report** exists. This excludes active/expired-under-goal/pending/draft/rejected/paused/cancelled campaigns and any campaign whose report is missing / pending / rejected. Surfaces: homepage Success Stories section (verified-only cards: **Report-Approved badge**, amount raised, goal, completion date, category, cover image, **View Completion Report** → `/campaigns/[slug]#completion-report`); a `/campaigns?filter=success` **Success Stories search filter** (server-side); creator profiles (include `funded`); and the public campaign page shows **"Successfully Completed"** (replacing the generic ended/funded notice) with a link to the report when an approved report exists. Sync is automatic — every surface derives live from `campaign_reports.status='approved'` + campaign status/goal, so approving/revoking a report adds/removes the campaign everywhere on next load (homepage within its ISR window).
- **Where:** `lib/success-stories.ts` (`getSuccessStories`, `getSuccessStoryIds` — the single qualification rule), `app/[locale]/page.tsx` (homepage section), `app/[locale]/campaigns/page.tsx` + `components/campaigns/CampaignFilters.tsx` (search filter), `components/campaigns/CampaignDetail.tsx` + `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/page.tsx` (messaging + `#completion-report` anchor), `app/[locale]/u/[username]/page.tsx` (creator profile). Uses `dict.home.success*` / `dict.filters.successStories*` / `dict.detail.successCompleted*`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. **No migration** — reuses existing `campaign_reports.status` + campaign `status`/goal (no denormalized flag, no duplicated data); server-side filtering over the small approved-report set. Fixed the prior bug where the homepage listed *any* `status='completed'` campaign regardless of goal or report.
- **Trust badge + ordering:** Homepage Success Story cards show a premium **"Verified Success Story"** badge (`components/campaigns/VerifiedSuccessBadge.tsx` — gold gradient `BadgeCheck`, tooltip on hover/tap, `role="tooltip"` + `aria`; rendered as a sibling over the cover, not nested in the `<Link>`). Ordering is a server-side 3-tier sort over the small approved set (reusing existing timestamps, no new fields): most-recent report `reviewed_at` → campaign `updated_at` (completion) → campaign `created_at`, then the newest 6 — so a newly-approved report jumps to the top automatically. `dict.home.verifiedBadge`/`verifiedTooltip`.

### Platform Fees — Mission & Transparency (`/fees`)
- **What:** The full mission/transparency explanation lives on the **Platform Fees page** (`/fees`), **not** the homepage — it was moved off the homepage so it no longer interrupts the donation flow or surfaces commissions to first-time visitors too early. `/fees` now covers: the **"Helping People Comes First"** mission (connect generous people with the individuals, families, and communities who need support; help people while keeping operations sustainable), a **"Why does XAYR charge a platform fee?"** section (donations go directly to the campaign organizer; any commission is used only to operate/improve XAYR), the cost-category checklist (payment processing, hosting, cloud infrastructure, security, fraud prevention, identity verification, customer support, platform maintenance/development), a sustainability note, and four transparency value cards (Mission First / Secure Donations / Verified Campaigns / Transparent Platform) — in the page's brand/dark design. The existing pricing cards + worked example remain (the **only** place a percentage appears). No nonprofit/legal claims. `/fees` is reachable from the footer **Support** group (alongside FAQ + Guide), so no main-nav clutter.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/fees/page.tsx`; copy in `locales/{uz,ru,en}/common.json` (`transparency.*` retained/reused; `feeWhyTitle` added). The homepage (`app/[locale]/page.tsx`) no longer renders the section. The `statVerifiedCampaigns`/`statSuccessful`/`statRaised` labels are reused by the Trust modal (below).
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. Production build + typecheck pass locally.

### Trust & Transparency Modal ("Why Trust XAYR?")
- **What:** A small, secondary **🛡️ Why Trust XAYR?** pill below the hero (centered above the homepage statistics grid; **not** a primary CTA) opens a **trust & transparency modal** — centered dialog on desktop, **bottom-sheet on mobile** — without leaving the homepage. Seven sections (Verified Campaigns, Secure Donations, Transparent Withdrawals, Completion Reports, Platform Fees, Your Privacy, Community Safety), a **real-data** trust-indicator strip (verified campaigns, successful campaigns, total donations, registered users, total raised — each **hidden when 0**), and a CTA row (Help Center → `/guide`, Contact Support → `/contact`, Platform Fees → `/fees`). No fixed fee % shown — the Platform Fees section reuses `transparency.feeBody`/`feeItems`. Accessible: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, labelled/described by title+subtitle, Esc-to-close, Tab focus-trap + focus restore, body scroll-lock. Reuses the ShareModal pattern (`animate-pop`, `items-end sm:items-center`, `rounded-t-3xl sm:rounded-3xl`).
- **Where:** `components/home/WhyTrustButton.tsx` (small trigger; **lazy-loads** the modal via `next/dynamic` `{ ssr:false }`, keeping its weight out of the homepage's initial JS), `components/home/WhyTrustModal.tsx` (the dialog), `app/[locale]/page.tsx` (`getPlatformStats` extended with `verifiedCampaigns`/`successfulCampaigns`/`registeredUsers`), `components/i18n/I18nProvider.tsx` (added `ta()` array-translation helper for bullet lists), copy in `locales/{uz,ru,en}/common.json` (`trust.*`).
- **Mobile (320–430px) hardening:** full-width bottom-sheet, `max-h-[90vh]`; body is `flex-1 min-h-0 overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain` so it scrolls **inside** the sheet (header/close pinned, page locked) — fixes content overflowing past the CTA; panel `overflow-hidden`; **drag-handle + swipe-down-to-close** (header-scoped, no scroll conflict); trigger button `whitespace-nowrap` + `min-h-[44px]` (44px touch target); single-column cards, `px-4`/`p-4` mobile padding, reduced heading/number sizes, full-width CTA buttons. Desktop (`sm:`) layout unchanged.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. Production build + typecheck pass locally.

### Creator Profiles & Following
- **What:** Public creator profile (`/u/[username]`) with Person JSON-LD; follow creators; followers notified on new campaign launch.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/u/[username]/page.tsx`, `components/profile/FollowButton.tsx`, `notify_followers_on_campaign_launch`. Table: `creator_followers`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Usernames
- **What:** Unique usernames with reserved list, strict format rules (no leading/trailing/consecutive dots, no `__`), live availability check, change-username RPC, auto-generation + OAuth auto-assign.
- **Where:** `lib/username.ts`, `lib/username-generator.ts`, `app/api/auth/username-available/route.ts`, RPCs `is_username_available` / `change_username` / `generate_username`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Search
- **What:** Postgres-side search over title/description/location + creator name (resolved to user_ids), with category/urgent filters, sort (newest, most_raised, most_donors, deadline), pagination. Trigram indexes back it.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/campaigns/page.tsx`, `components/campaigns/{CampaignFilters,CampaignGrid,Pagination}.tsx`.
- **Status:** ⚠️ Functional `ilike`-based search; not fuzzy/ranked full-text.

### SEO
- **What:** Dynamic metadata, canonical + hreflang (uz/ru/en + x-default), dynamic per-campaign OG images, JSON-LD (Organization, WebSite+SearchAction, BreadcrumbList, WebPage, DonateAction, Person, FAQPage), dynamic sitemap with image entries, robots.
- **Where:** `lib/seo.ts`, `lib/campaign-jsonld.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, `app/opengraph-image.tsx`, `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx`, `app/manifest.ts`.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete and strong.

### Admin
- **What:** Dashboard with stats; manage campaigns, reconcile donations, resolve flags, manage users + roles, review verifications, manage payouts, read contact messages.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/admin/*`, `components/admin/*`, `app/api/admin/{set-role,verifications}/route.ts`, `admin_stats` view.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete. Rate-limited at the middleware layer; RBAC re-verified server-side on each route.

### Payouts
- **What:** Creator requests a withdrawal (bank/card) against available balance; 3% platform commission computed; admin state machine (`pending_review → approved → paid`, plus `info_requested`/`rejected`/`cancelled`); full event log. The whole flow lives on a **dedicated Withdrawal page** (`/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/withdraw`) — payout information appears ONLY here, never on the Profile or Analytics pages. Order on the page: **Available Balance → Saved Payout Information (or the form when missing) → Withdrawal Request Form → Withdrawal History**. No account yet → the `PayoutAccountForm` shows inline first; account exists → a **read-only masked card** (legal name, phone, card type, masked card `8600 **** **** 9012`, cardholder, bank) with an inline **Edit** (same form, no page change). Saving reveals the card and enables the withdraw button; the request snapshots the account server-side, so card details are never re-entered. The full card number is masked for creators (BIN + last 4) and never serialized to the page payload — the unmasked record is fetched on demand (RLS owner-only) just for the edit form; admins still see the full PAN in the admin payout dashboard. The dashboard "Withdraw" button and an Analytics-page button both link to `/withdraw`.
- **Where:** Page `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/withdraw/page.tsx` (builds the masked projection + balance) renders `components/campaigns/CampaignPayouts.tsx`, which hosts the inline `components/profile/PayoutAccountForm.tsx` via its `embedded`/`onSaved`/`onCancel` props. Admin side: `components/admin/AdminPayouts.tsx`, `app/[locale]/admin/payouts/page.tsx`. Masking helper `maskCardDisplay` in `lib/payout.ts`. RPCs: `create_payout_request`, `approve_payout_request`, `reject_payout_request`, `request_payout_info`, `mark_payout_paid`, `campaign_available_balance`. Tables: `payout_requests`, `payout_request_events`, `payout_accounts`.
- **Status:** ✅ Code-complete; ⚠️ functionally meaningless until donations actually complete (depends on payments).

### Financial Transparency & Ledger
- **What:** End-to-end financial tracking — every money movement is auto-recorded in an **immutable, append-only ledger** (`financial_ledger`: donation/refund/platform_fee/provider_fee/withdrawal/adjustment/admin_correction; signed amount; UPDATE/DELETE blocked by a guard trigger; `source_key` dedupe). Triggers record entries from `donations` (completed → donation, un-complete → refund) and `payout_requests` (paid → withdrawal + platform_fee); the migration backfills existing data. **Admin Financial Dashboard** (`/admin/finance`) shows the full metric set (total donations, net-to-creators, withdrawn, platform/provider fees, refunded, available-for-withdrawal, pending withdrawals/payments, avg/largest, # donations) + today/week/month/year windows + a **Financial Integrity Warning** (`check_financial_integrity()` flags campaigns whose books don't reconcile) + recent ledger + **CSV export** (`/api/admin/finance/export`). **Public Transparency page** (`/transparency`, ISR) shows aggregated, PII-free stats (`public_financial_stats()`: total donations, raised, delivered, successful/active/verified campaigns, users). **Per-campaign financial breakdown + money-flow timeline** on the owner withdrawal page (goal/raised/platform fee/provider fee/net/withdrawn/available/pending/remaining, computed from tamper-proof balances). Admin manual adjustments require admin + reason and are logged to `admin_audit_log` (`record_ledger_adjustment`). All aggregation runs in Postgres (`financial_summary` view, RPCs) — no donation-table scan in app code; fetchers fail closed to safe zeros.
- **Where:** `supabase/financial-ledger.sql` (#45), `lib/finance.ts`, `app/[locale]/admin/finance/page.tsx`, `app/api/admin/finance/export/route.ts`, `app/[locale]/transparency/page.tsx`, `components/campaigns/CampaignFinancials.tsx` (+ `app/[locale]/campaigns/[slug]/withdraw/page.tsx`), `components/admin/AdminNav.tsx` + `components/layout/Footer.tsx` (nav links), `types/index.ts`, `locales/{uz,ru,en}/common.json` (`fin.*`, `transparencyPage.*`, `campaignFinance.*`).
- **Status:** ✅ #45 live on `main` (`bd7189d`). **#46 (`financial-snapshots.sql`) adds:** daily `financial_snapshots` + idempotent generator + Vercel cron (`/api/cron/financial-snapshot`, reuses `CRON_SECRET`); ledger extension (`user_id`/`reference_id`, granular withdrawal-lifecycle + chargeback types); `reconciliation_report()`; **monthly money-flow charts** (admin + public, dependency-free inline SVG); **period tabs** (Today/Week/Month/Year/All-Time); **Excel** (`?format=xls`) + **PDF** (print-styled `/admin/finance/report`) export; avg/largest on `/transparency`. ⚠️ **Pending migration #46 applied in Supabase** (charts/snapshot cron need it; everything else degrades to safe zeros). ⏳ Remaining: provider-fee (no gateway → 0), advanced admin filters (campaign/user/provider dropdowns), one-click server-generated PDF (print view shipped).

### Contact
- **What:** Public contact form storing messages; admin inbox with read state.
- **Where:** `components/contact/ContactForm.tsx`, `app/[locale]/contact/page.tsx`, `components/admin/AdminMessages.tsx`. Table: `contact_messages`.
- **Status:** ✅ Stored + readable; ⚠️ no email reply mechanism.

### Mobile
- **What:** Bottom navigation, 48px touch targets, responsive Tailwind layouts, sticky donate actions on campaign detail, PWA manifest.
- **Where:** `components/layout/BottomNav.tsx`, `app/manifest.ts`, responsive classes throughout.
- **Status:** ✅ Complete.

### Performance
- **What:** Single paginated indexed listing query, `force-dynamic` only where required, ISR (`revalidate=60`) on home, lazy dictionary import, Next/Image with remote allowlist, trigram + composite indexes.
- **Where:** `app/[locale]/campaigns/page.tsx`, `app/[locale]/page.tsx`, `supabase/optimize-campaign-indexes.sql`, `next.config.mjs`.
- **Status:** ✅ Solid for current scale.

### Legal Center / Static
- **Legal Center** — six long-form legal documents, fully translated (uz/ru/en) and rendered by the shared `components/legal/LegalDocument.tsx` (title/subtitle/effective-date/table-of-contents/sections), content 100% from the dictionary (`legal.*`): **Public Offer** (`/offer` — platform role, voluntary donations, verification-but-no-guarantee, transparent fees, acceptance), **Refund Policy** (`/refund` — when refunds are/aren't possible, after-transfer, failed & duplicate payments, support), **Terms of Service** (`/terms`), **Privacy Policy** (`/privacy`), **Cookie Policy** (`/cookies`), **Campaign Verification & Withdrawal Rules** (`/verification-rules` — KYC, campaign review, manual withdrawal review, completion reports, extensions, fraud investigations). All linked from the footer under a **Legal** group (`legalLinks`, always-visible legal row + `aria-label`). Other static: security, fees, FAQ (`components/faq/FaqList.tsx`), guide. ✅ Present.

## 4. Features In Progress

| System | Exists | Missing | Remaining work |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Payment gateway** | Provider abstraction, webhook endpoint, idempotency dedupe, amount/currency verification, `payment_events` audit, `manual` provider | A real provider (Click/Payme) implementing `createPayment` + `verifyWebhook` | Implement one provider, register it, sandbox-test signature + webhook, wire method selection into `DonationForm`. |
| **Push notifications** | Full client + server code, preferences table, webhook handler | Live OneSignal app + Supabase DB-webhook config | Configure dashboards; verify end-to-end delivery. |
| **Analytics** | Per-campaign creator analytics | Platform-wide product analytics | Add Plausible/PostHog (or similar) + an admin analytics view. |
| **Search** | `ilike` + filters + trigram indexes | Ranked/fuzzy full-text | Add `tsvector` column + ranking, or typo tolerance. |
| **Refunds** | `refunded` status in enum | No flow/UI/trigger | Build refund handling once a gateway exists. |
| **Email** | Supabase Auth transactional emails only | Receipts, payout confirmations, contact replies | Integrate a transactional email provider. |

---

## 5. Planned Features

### High Priority
1. Live Click **or** Payme payment integration (unblocks the whole money flow).
2. Verify + apply all DB migrations to production; record live status.
3. Transactional email (donation receipts, payout confirmations, contact replies).
4. Automated tests (payment idempotency, RLS, donation→credit trigger) + committed lockfile.

### Medium Priority
5. Platform-level analytics + admin analytics dashboard.
6. Refund flow (status, trigger, admin UI).
7. Full-text/fuzzy search upgrade.
8. ~~Error monitoring (Sentry)~~ ✅ done — structured logging still pending.
9. Constant-time webhook secret comparison + share/flag insert rate-limiting.

### Future Ideas
10. Real admin-curated featured campaigns (`is_featured` column + admin control).
11. Recurring/subscription donations.
12. Campaign comments moderation tooling.
13. Multi-sitemap index when catalog approaches scale limits.
14. Donation receipt / "your impact" downloadable PDF.

---

## 6. Database

PostgreSQL 15 on Supabase. Every base table has **RLS enabled**. `updated_at` is
maintained by `set_updated_at()` triggers where present.

### Tables

| Table | Purpose | Key relationships | Notable RLS / triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | Public profile (1:1 with `auth.users`) | `id → auth.users` | Select all; insert/update self only. Column-level grants exclude `role`/`verification_status`. `handle_new_user` populates on signup. |
| `categories` | Campaign categories (3-language labels) | referenced by `campaigns` | Select all; admin-only write. Seeded with 8 categories. |
| `campaigns` | Fundraising campaigns | `user_id → users`, `category_id → categories` | Select active/own/admin; insert own (KYC-gated); update own/admin. `guard_campaign_protected_fields` blocks owner edits to status/totals/views. |
| `donations` | Donation/transaction records | `campaign_id → campaigns`, `donor_id → users` (nullable = guest) | Insert restricted to `pending` (post-migration #5); select scoped to donor/owner/admin. `apply_donation` credits campaign on completion. `payment_ref` UNIQUE (migration #38). |

| `saved_campaigns` | Bookmarks | `user_id`, `campaign_id` (unique pair) | Own-row only. |
| `recently_viewed` | Per-user view history | `user_id`, `campaign_id` | Own-row only; deduped/pruned in RPC. |
| `campaign_reports` | Completion reports | `campaign_id`, `user_id` | Owner/manager write on completed campaigns; select all. `notify_donors_on_report`. |
| `campaign_flags` | Abuse reports | `campaign_id`, `reporter_id → users` | Authenticated insert; admin resolve. |
| `creator_followers` | Follow relationships | `follower_id`, `creator_id` | Own-row scoped. `notify_followers_on_campaign_launch`. |
| `campaign_team_members` | Team roles | `campaign_id`, `user_id` | Team-aware policies; `campaign_role` helper. |
| `contact_messages` | Contact form inbox | — | Public insert; admin read/update. |
| `admin_audit_log` | Admin action log (scaffolding) | `admin_id → users` | Admin-only. **Currently unused** (manual donation tool removed). |
| `payment_events` | Webhook audit / idempotency / reconciliation | `donation_id → donations` | Admin-only read; written by service role. `provider_event_id` dedupe. |
| `campaign_shares` | Share tracking | `campaign_id` | Anonymous insert (source CHECK-restricted); `get_share_stats` owner-only read. |
| `notification_preferences` | Push preference matrix | `user_id (PK)` | Own-row scoped. |
| `payout_requests` | Withdrawal requests | `campaign_id`, `user_id`, `reviewed_by` | Created/read via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs; state machine + 3% commission. |
| `payout_request_events` | Payout audit trail | `request_id → payout_requests` | Written by payout RPCs; `notify_on_payout_event`. |
| `verification_requests` | KYC submissions | `user_id`, `reviewed_by` | Insert/read own + admin; status drives publish gate. |
| `identity_documents` | KYC document pointers | `request_id`, `user_id` | Paths in private bucket; admin signed-URL access only. |

## 10. Deployment

**GitHub** — Repository on `main`. CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on push/PR to `main` →
`npm install` → `npm run typecheck` → `npm run build` (with placeholder Supabase env).
No lint step (no ESLint config). **No `package-lock.json` committed** (so `npm ci`/cache disabled).

**Vercel** — Framework auto-detected (`vercel.json`). Set all required env vars (§9) at server scope.
Image remote patterns restricted in `next.config.mjs` to the Supabase project host + `images.unsplash.com`.

**Supabase** — Run migrations in order (§7) via SQL Editor; verify with `verify-migrations.sql`.
Configure: Google OAuth provider (for #27), OneSignal + DB webhook on `notifications` insert (for #29).
Confirm storage buckets exist (`campaign-images`, `profile-photos`, `campaign-reports`, `verification-documents`).

**Custom domain** — `xayr.uz` (referenced in CI build env + SEO). Point DNS at Vercel; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://xayr.uz`.

**Environment setup** — Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`, fill values; mirror into Vercel.

**Production deployment steps**
1. Merge to `main` → CI runs typecheck + build.
2. Vercel auto-deploys on green.
3. Apply any new migrations in Supabase **before** the deploy depends on them; re-run the verifier.

**Rollback**
- App: redeploy a previous Vercel deployment (instant) or revert the commit and let CI/Vercel rebuild.
- DB: migrations are forward-only and idempotent — no automatic down-migrations. Roll back schema changes by writing a compensating migration. Plan DB changes to be backward-compatible with the previous app version.

---

## 11. Payment System Status

**Architecture.** Provider-agnostic abstraction in `lib/payments/`:
- `types.ts` — `PaymentProvider` contract (`createPayment`, optional `verifyWebhook`), `PaymentIntent`, `WebhookResult`.
- `index.ts` — provider registry + `getPaymentProvider()`.
- `providers/manual.ts` — the only registered provider (records pending, no charge).
- `confirm.ts` — `confirmDonation()` (service-role, idempotent; amount **and** currency are **mandatory** and fail closed; a definitive mismatch marks the donation `failed` + alerts admins, never left pending).
- **Money-loss hardening (2026-06-24, see `docs/payment-security-audit.md`):** M1 webhook signature enforcement (reject on `signatureValid===false`), M2 mandatory amount/currency, M3 refund reversal (`supabase/payment-refund-reversal.sql` — reverses campaign totals + payout availability on refund/fail), M5 mismatch→failed+admin alert. **M4 (migration #5 live in prod) remains UNVERIFIED — run `verify-migrations.sql` before enabling payments.**
- `helpers.ts` — `createPaymentEvent`, `isDuplicateWebhook`, `markPaymentProcessed`, `validatePaymentAmount`, `validateCurrency`.

**Current flow.** `DonationForm` → `POST /api/donations` → service-role insert as `pending` → `manual` provider returns a `manual_<id>` reference + "coming soon" instructions → `payment_ref` saved. `apply_donation` credits the campaign **only** when a donation reaches `completed`.

**Current limitations.**
- No real gateway: nothing transitions a donation to `completed` automatically.
- The manual admin-completion tool was **removed** (migration #31 notes), so there is currently **no in-app path** to complete a donation — only a direct service-role DB write.
- `DonationForm` does not present payment-method selection.

**Ready for providers?** **Yes.** The webhook route (`/api/payments/webhook`) already verifies signatures (delegated), dedupes by `provider_event_id`, logs to `payment_events`, confirms with server-side amount/currency checks, and marks processed/retryable. Registering a provider in `index.ts` activates the full path with no other changes.

**Missing work.** Implement `createPayment` + `verifyWebhook` for Click or Payme; register it; add method selection to the donation UI; sandbox-test; add refund handling.

**Merchant requirements.** A registered Uzbek merchant account with Click and/or Payme; merchant/service IDs + secret keys (env vars already scaffolded); a public webhook URL allow-listed with the provider.

---

## 12. Security

- **RLS** — Enabled on every base table; policies scope reads/writes to owner/admin/public as appropriate. Donations insert restricted to `pending` (migration #5). Protected campaign columns guarded by trigger. *Live application unverified — run the verifier.*
- **Authentication** — Supabase Auth (email/password + Google OAuth, PKCE); email-confirmation publish gate; middleware refreshes sessions and **fails open** so auth issues never 500 the whole site (every protected surface re-checks server-side).
- **Authorization** — Admin routes re-verify `role='admin'` server-side via `auth.getUser()` before any service-role write. Role changes only through `/api/admin/set-role` (self-change blocked). Users cannot self-promote (column grants exclude `role`/`verification_status`).
- **Storage** — Own-folder policies on public buckets; `verification-documents` private with 5-minute admin signed URLs; KYC submit validates paths are in the user's folder.
- **Rate limiting** — Upstash sliding-window via the shared `enforceRateLimit` / `rateLimitOr429` helpers (`lib/rate-limit.ts`); fails open if Redis is unavailable. Buckets: login, signup, reset (password reset), donation, campaign (creation), contact, search, notifications, admin, views. Search + notifications are limited at the middleware layer (prefetch-excluded; search only when a `q` query is present) since they have no API route; admin routes/pages are limited in middleware.
- **Bot protection (Turnstile)** — Cloudflare Turnstile on register, login, password reset, contact, campaign creation, and KYC submission. Always verified server-side (`lib/security/turnstile.ts`); the client token is never trusted. Fails open only when unconfigured (dev). Setup: `docs/turnstile-setup.md`.
- **Validation** — Zod on all API inputs; username sanitization/format enforcement; UUID checks.
- **Webhook & redirect hardening** — The push webhook's shared secret is compared in **constant time** (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`, `lib/security/timing-safe.ts`), closing a timing side-channel. Post-auth redirect targets (`next`) pass through a single `safeNextPath()` guard (`lib/security/redirect.ts`) that rejects external / protocol-relative / backslash-smuggled / control-char paths and falls back to `/` — used by the auth callback **and** the login form. The payment webhook already fails closed on `signatureValid === false` and dedupes replays by `provider_event_id`.
- **Security headers** — Set in `next.config.mjs` for all routes: `Content-Security-Policy` (scoped to Supabase REST+realtime, OneSignal SDK/API, Turnstile; `'unsafe-inline'` for Next's inline scripts/styles, `img-src https:`), `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy` (camera/mic/geo/payment/topics off), `Strict-Transport-Security` (2y, includeSubDomains, preload). `upgrade-insecure-requests` is production-only.
- **Error monitoring** — Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) tracks frontend, API/server, and middleware errors via `instrumentation.ts` (`onRequestError`), `sentry.{client,server,edge}.config.ts`, and `app/global-error.tsx`. Inert without a DSN. DSN is public; the source-map auth token is a build-time secret. Setup: `docs/sentry-setup.md`.
- **Secrets** — Service role, OneSignal REST key, webhook secret kept server-only (never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`).
- **XSS** — User content rendered as text; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` used only for `JSON.stringify`'d JSON-LD (5 controlled sites).

**Known risks**
| Sev | Item |
|---|---|
| 🔴 | Broad `SELECT` on `public.users` exposes `email`/`phone`/`rejection_reason` to anyone with the anon key (PII enumeration). See `docs/rls-audit.md` F1 — needs a coordinated schema+app fix (public-safe view / PII split), not a blind change. |
| ⚠️ | Live RLS unverified — biggest real risk if migration #5 (and others) aren't applied in prod. |
| 🟡 | `campaign_shares` / `campaign_flags` allow anonymous/auth insert → analytics/spam inflation. |

## 13. Localization

- **Languages:** Uzbek (default), Russian, English. Config in `i18n/config.ts`; routing via `/[locale]/…` + `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie + middleware redirect.
- **Coverage:** `locales/{uz,ru,en}/common.json` — all three are **1352 lines** (parity maintained). Server dictionaries loaded lazily (`i18n/dictionaries.ts`).
- **Missing translations:** No structural gaps detected (equal line counts). Some Uzbek UI strings are hardcoded in components/API error messages (e.g. toast text in `DonationForm`, API error strings) rather than dictionary-driven.
- **Remaining work:** Extract hardcoded UI/toast/API strings into the dictionaries for full coverage; add a CI check that locale files stay key-aligned.

---

## 14. Mobile Experience

- **Implemented:** Bottom navigation (`components/layout/BottomNav.tsx`), 48px min touch targets (donation presets/buttons), responsive grids throughout, sticky donate action on campaign detail, PWA manifest (`app/manifest.ts`), apple-icon.
- **Responsive layout:** Tailwind breakpoints (`sm`/`md`/`lg`) used consistently across home, listing, detail, admin.
- **Bottom navigation:** Present for primary navigation on small screens.
- **Sticky actions:** Donate flow surfaces a persistent CTA.
- **Remaining improvements:** Native app wrapper (optional), offline support beyond manifest, mobile-specific image size tuning audit.

---

## 15. SEO

- **Implementation:** `lib/seo.ts` (`pageMetadata`, `buildAlternates`), `lib/campaign-jsonld.ts`.
- **Metadata:** Dynamic per-page `title`/`description` (localized).
- **Open Graph / Twitter:** `summary_large_image`; dynamic per-campaign OG image (1200×630 with photo + progress + brand, gradient fallback); default branded OG card.
- **Structured data (JSON-LD):** Organization + WebSite (with SearchAction) site-wide; per-campaign `@graph` (BreadcrumbList, WebPage, DonateAction); Person on creator profiles; FAQPage on `/faq`.
- **Sitemap:** `app/sitemap.ts` — dynamic, active campaigns, `lastModified` from `updated_at`, image entries, hreflang alternates, hourly revalidate, capped at 5000 campaigns.
- **Robots:** `app/robots.ts` — allows public; disallows `/api`, `/admin`, `/profile`, `/auth`, `/notifications`; points to sitemap.
- **Canonical / hreflang:** Canonical + `uz`/`ru`/`en` + `x-default` on every page.
- **Remaining improvements:** Per-campaign OG alt text (currently generic); `Article` structured data on campaign updates; submit sitemap to Google Search Console; sitemap-index when catalog grows.

## 16. Performance

- **Caching:** Home uses ISR (`revalidate=60`); sitemap revalidates hourly; listing is `force-dynamic` (filter/pagination dependent).
- **Optimization:** Single paginated, indexed listing query (only one page transferred); platform stats fetched in parallel; trigram + composite indexes (`optimize-campaign-indexes.sql`).
- **Image loading:** Next/Image with `sizes`, `quality`, remote-host allowlist; gradient fallbacks.
- **Code splitting:** RSC by default; client components scoped; dictionaries dynamically imported per locale.
- **Known bottlenecks:** Search runs a secondary creator-lookup query then an OR filter (acceptable now; revisit at scale). No CDN-level caching strategy documented beyond Vercel defaults. No DB connection pooling notes (Supabase-managed).

## 17. Known Issues

| Sev | Description | Location | Suggested fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Critical | No real payment gateway — donations never auto-complete; no in-app completion path (manual tool removed) | `lib/payments/providers/`, `app/api/donations/route.ts` | Implement & register a Click/Payme provider. |
| 🔴 Critical | Live RLS unverified — base `schema.sql` allows `donations_insert_any`; only migration #5 restricts to pending. If #5 isn't applied, totals are forgeable | `supabase/secure-donations-rls.sql` | Run `verify-migrations.sql`; apply #5 (and all) in prod. |
| 🟠 High | No `package-lock.json` → non-reproducible builds; CI can't use `npm ci` | repo root, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Commit a lockfile; switch CI to `npm ci`. |
| 🟠 High | No automated tests; CI = typecheck + build only | repo-wide | Add tests for payment idempotency, RLS, donation trigger. |
| 🟡 Medium | No transactional email (receipts, payout confirmations, contact replies) | — | Integrate an email provider. |
| 🔴 Critical | Broad `SELECT` on `public.users` leaks `email`/`phone`/`rejection_reason` (PII enumeration via anon key) | `supabase/schema.sql` `users_select_all` | Public-safe profile view or split PII into own-row-RLS table; see `docs/rls-audit.md` F1. |
| 🟡 Low | `campaign_shares` / `campaign_flags` insert inflation | flag/share insert paths | Rate-limit or server-throttle. |
| 🟡 Low | Hardcoded Uzbek strings in some components/API errors bypass i18n | `components/donations/DonationForm.tsx`, various API routes | Move into dictionaries. |
| ✅ Fixed | ~~Push webhook secret compare not constant-time~~ → `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (`lib/security/timing-safe.ts`) | `app/api/push/notify/route.ts` | Done. |
| ✅ Fixed | ~~Auth callback `next` not restricted to relative paths~~ → centralized `safeNextPath()` guard | `lib/security/redirect.ts`, `app/auth/callback/route.ts`, `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` | Done. |

## 18. Technical Debt

- **Dual schema source of truth:** `supabase/schema.sql` and `supabase/000_master_migration.sql` both exist — drift risk. Document which is canonical.
- **Unused scaffolding:** `admin_audit_log` table retained but no writer remains (manual donation tool removed). Either use it for admin-action logging or drop it.
- **Provider registry comment vs reality:** `lib/payments/index.ts` references Click/Payme that don't exist yet (clearly marked as future, but reads as more-than-present).
- **No ESLint config:** `next lint` intentionally skipped; lint-class issues uncaught.
- **Hardcoded copy:** Toast/error strings not fully i18n-driven (see §13/§17).
- **`as unknown as Campaign[]` casts** in listing/home queries — acceptable but loosens type safety at the data boundary.
- **No down-migrations / migration tooling:** all manual + forward-only.

## 19. Launch Checklist

### Critical (block launch with real money)
- [ ] Implement & register a live payment provider (Click or Payme).
- [ ] Add payment-method selection to the donation UI.
- [ ] Run **all** migrations in production; confirm with `verify-migrations.sql` (esp. #5 donations RLS).
- [ ] Commit `package-lock.json`; switch CI to `npm ci`.
- [ ] Set all required env vars in Vercel (server scope), no secrets as `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- [ ] Verify storage buckets + RLS exist (incl. private `verification-documents`).
- [ ] Smoke-test full flow: signup → KYC → create → donate → complete (webhook) → payout.

### Recommended
- [ ] Add automated tests (payment idempotency, RLS, donation→credit).
- [ ] Transactional email (receipts, payout confirmations, contact replies).
- [ ] Configure OneSignal + Supabase notification webhook (live push).
- [x] Constant-time webhook secret compare; restrict auth-callback `next` (`lib/security/{timing-safe,redirect}.ts`).
- [x] Error monitoring (Sentry) — `docs/sentry-setup.md`.
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console.

### Optional
- [ ] Rate-limit share/flag inserts.
- [ ] Platform analytics (Plausible/PostHog).
- [ ] Full-text search upgrade.
- [ ] Real admin-curated featured campaigns.
- [ ] Refund flow.

## 20. Investor Readiness

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Technical readiness** | **High.** Clean, typed, documented Next.js 15 + Supabase architecture; strong SEO/i18n/mobile; thoughtful security design and internal audit docs. |
| **Business readiness** | **Medium.** Complete creator→donor→reporting→payout product loop is built; cannot yet transact real money. Demonstrable as a working product minus live charging. |
| **Payment readiness** | **Low.** Abstraction is production-grade and provider-ready, but no live gateway — the single biggest gap. ~5–10 working days to money-ready MVP. |
| **Security** | **Medium-High.** Strong model (tamper-proof donations, column grants, guarded fields, service-role confinement). Gated on verifying RLS is actually applied in production. |
| **Scalability** | **Medium-High.** Indexed, paginated queries; serverless on Vercel + managed Postgres. Manual migrations and absence of tests are the main scaling-process risks. |

**Bottom line:** A polished, near-complete platform whose only critical blocker to launch is live payment integration plus verifying production RLS.
